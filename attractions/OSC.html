          At the Ontario Science Centre’s Above & Beyond: An Interactive Flight exhibition, you can learn about the history of air and space travel. The exhibit features immersive and hands-on activities including riding a space elevator or being the pilot of a jet! While you’re there, explore the other interactive exhibits as well (over 500 of them), including an immersive, hyper-realistic rainforest. 
          Established in 1969, the Ontario Science Centre (770 Don Mills Rd.) has been engaging visitors with innovative science and technology experiences for 50 years. Upon opening its doors, the Ontario Science Centre was a pioneer in its hands-on approach to science. Unlike traditional museums at the time, where exhibits were strictly for viewing only, the Ontario Science Centre promoted interaction and live demonstrations. The Science Centre even has its own amateur radio station since its opening in 1969 and incorporated its very first—and Ontario’s one and only—IMAX Dome theatre in 1996.
          The Ontario Science Centre is designed in a Brutalist style popular in the 1960s and is composed of three main buildings that are interlinked with a series of bridges and escalators. The complex also traces and descends into the contours of the Don River Ravine.
          Learn about outer space at the Science Centre’s planetarium, and even examine actual meteorites from planet Mars. Read about the stories of elite athletes, survivalists, and others who have gone beyond the limits of the human body at the AstraZeneca Human Edge, or experience the raw power of the planet earth by “touching” a tornado and meeting colourful but lethal poison dart frogs in The Living Earth.
