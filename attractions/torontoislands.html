        The Toronto Islands have the oldest lighthouse on the Great Lakes. If you love history, then this 200-year-old monument is for you. And if you’re in search of ghosts for Halloween, here’s a good place to start. The Gibraltar Point Beach Lighthouse is one of Toronto’s oldest buildings dating back to 1809 and is also supposedly haunted by its first keeper, John Paul Radelmüller. As the story goes, he disappeared under mysterious circumstances and still guards the lighthouse to this day. Ferries to the island depart from Queens Quay daily. Tickets can be purchased online.
