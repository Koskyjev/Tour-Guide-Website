        <p> The CN Tower (French: Tour CN) is a 553.3 m-high (1,815.3 ft) concrete communications and observation tower in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Built on the former Railway Lands, it was completed in 1976. Its name "CN" referred to Canadian National, the railway company that built the tower. Following the railway's decision to divest non-core freight railway assets prior to the company's privatization in 1995, it transferred the tower to the Canada Lands Company, a federal Crown corporation responsible for real estate development. Towering over the city at 1,815 ft, the CN Tower is Toronto’s landmark attraction and is famous for offering unparalleled views of the city. A little-known tidbit is that as the tallest structure in the city, it’s no stranger to lightning. In fact, it gets struck around 75 times per year. Do a quick CN Tower search on Instagram and you’ll come across jaw-dropping photos of the gorgeous occurrence. Thankfully, the Tower’s build is more than equipped to handle it, with electrons easily flowing through and causing zero damage—just incredibly cool photos. Who knows, next time you visit maybe lightning will strike.

            The CN Tower held the record for the world's tallest free-standing structure for 32 years, from 1975 until 2007, when it was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa, and was the world's tallest tower until 2009 when it was surpassed by the Canton Tower. It is currently the tenth-tallest free-standing structure in the world and remains the tallest free-standing structure on land in the Western Hemisphere. In 1995, the CN Tower was declared one of the modern Seven Wonders of the World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. It also belongs to the World Federation of Great Towers.
            It is a signature icon of Toronto's skyline and attracts more than two million international visitors annually. It houses several observation decks, a revolving restaurant at some 350 metres (1,150 ft), and an entertainment complex.</p>
